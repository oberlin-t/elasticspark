      <h1>Welcome to Elasticspark!</h1>
      <p><b>Status of this Website:</b><br/>This website is very much a WIP. Not only does it not only do anything, but I don't even know what I want it to do. For now it will serve as a gallery for images of my cat.<br/><br/><b>Future Plans?:</b> I am thinking that in the future I might create an internet texting program on this website, or even a video game? Idk. I also have less ambitious plans for doing things such as adding a menu bar, or allowing people to change viewing settings. I might also get some friends to design a logo for the website.</p>
